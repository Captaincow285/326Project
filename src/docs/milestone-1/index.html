            <p>
                Music is a meaningful way for people to communicate thoughts, emotions, and other aspects of
                the human experience to one another. Sharing what songs, artists, and genres one is listening
                to is a form of socializing that is highly demanded by many. However, today's most popular
                music streaming services (Spotify, Apple Music, etc.) do not provide outlets for users to
                easily share their music tastes on a broad scale. TuneShare aims to address this issue by
                offering a place for music listeners to share Spotify playlists with not just their friends,
                but all users of the site. Similar to traditional social media platforms, our application will
                have features that allow users with an account to post playlists, upvote or downvote the
                playlists of others, suggest additions to playlists, and more.

            <p>
              Structuring the data of our application will be crucial for
              scalability and ease of development. For our project, we will need to
              store four types of data: users, playlists, votes, and comments.
            </p>
            <p>
              User authentication will be a cornerstone of our application. Each
              user will have a unique identifier, "UserID", which will be crucial
              for linking users to playlists, comments, and votes. Beyond a unique
              identifier, we will store each user&apos;s email address, username,
              and password. For security, we will run passwords through a hash
              function, so we will not have direct access to the user's passwords.
              Storing this information will be important for account creation and
              login purposes. Optional information we may keep track of may include
              profile pictures and bios.
            </p>
            <p>
              Upvotes and downvotes are a simple way to gauge the quality and
              popularity of playlists posted on our platform. We wish to keep track
              of which user cast a vote, as well as if it is an upvote or downvote.
              For this we will assign each vote a "VoteID", the "PlaylistID" of the
              post the vote is cast on, the "UserID" of the user who cast the vote,
              and a field such as "IsUpvote" to distinguish types of votes. By
              modeling votes in this way, we hope to allow users to influence the
              ranking of playlists posted on the platform seamlessly.
            </p>
            <p>
              Comments serve to add a layer of interaction and discussion between
              users. To implement a comment system we will need to keep track of the
              "UserID" of the user that posted the comment, the "PlaylistID" of the
              post where the comment resides, as well as a timestamp to display the
              age of a comment, and of course the content of the comment itself.
              Optionally we may add features such as replying to comments, and an
              upvote/downvote system for comments.
            </p>
            <p>
              The playlist data model will serve as the heart of the application,
              the primary content around which users interact with. Each playlist
              will have a unique "PlaylistID", as well as a "UserID" to associate
              the user who submitted the playlist. We will have a field for the URL
              of the playlist on Spotify, which will be especially important when
              fetching information such as the tracklist and cover image. Other
              fields we wish to include are the title, description, and creation
              timestamp. The handling of playlist data via the Spotify API will be
              an essential part of our application. Data will be fetched using the
              Spotify URL asynchronously and loaded onto the page. This will ensure
              that every playlist posted on the site is always up-to-date.
            </p>
            <p>
              In conclusion, the thoughtful structuring and management of data will
              ensure our application is scalable. By carefully designing data models
              for users, votes, comments, and playlists, we lay the groundwork for a
              dynamic and secure platform.

                The creation and deployment of Tuneshare will serve as an important 
                collaborative experience for the members of this group. Via the 
                development of this application, group members will draw on classroom 
                experience in data analysis, human-centered design, data structures, and 
                simple algorithms to collaborate on an application that resembles commonly 
                available technologies Being similar to real technologies in use, this 
                integrative experience provides group members with context and understanding 
                of how to apply their skills to real-world situations. The collaborative 
                project-based nature of this assignment closely mimics a workplace 
                environment, forcing group members to develop and utilize communication 
                and management skills to keep the project on schedule. Through this project, 
                students will gain experience in a development environment, preparing them 
                for post-undergraduate experiences.
