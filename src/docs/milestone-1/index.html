                    Music is a meaningful way for people to communicate thoughts, emotions, and other aspects of
                    the human experience to one another. Sharing what songs, artists, and genres one is listening
                    to is a form of socializing that is highly demanded by many. However, today's most popular
                    music streaming services (Spotify, Apple Music, etc.) do not provide outlets for users to
                    easily share their music tastes on a broad scale. TuneShare aims to address this issue by
                    offering a place for music listeners to share Spotify playlists with not just their friends,
                    but all users of the site. Similar to traditional social media platforms, our application will
                    have features that allow users with an account to post playlists, upvote or downvote the
                    playlists of others, suggest additions to playlists, and more.
