                Music is a meaningful way for people to communicate thoughts, emotions, and other aspects of
                the human experience to one another. Sharing what songs, artists, and genres one is listening
                to is a form of socializing that is highly demanded by many. However, today's most popular
                music streaming services (Spotify, Apple Music, etc.) do not provide outlets for users to
                easily share their music tastes on a broad scale. TuneShare aims to address this issue by
                offering a place for music listeners to share Spotify playlists with not just their friends,
                but all users of the site. Similar to traditional social media platforms, our application will
                have features that allow users with an account to post playlists, upvote or downvote the
                playlists of others, suggest additions to playlists, and more.

                Structuring the data of our application will be crucial for scalability and ease of development. For our
                project, we will need to store four types of data: users, playlists, votes, and comments.

                The user data model is a cornerstone of our application, enabling essential features such as user
                authentication and profile personalization. Each user will have a unique identifier (ex. UserID), which
                is crucial for linking users to playlists, votes, and comments. We also want to store username and email
                fields as these will be important for account creation and login. For security purposes, passwords will
                be stored using a hashing algorithm. Optional features we may include to enhance user experience and
                personalization are profile pictures and user bios.

                Upvotes and downvotes are a simple, yet powerful way to gauge the quality and popularity of playlists
                posted on our platform. Each vote should Have a VoteID, along with a PlaylistID and UserID to link votes
                to a specific playlist as well as the user who cast it. We will also include a boolean field such as
                IsUpvote to determine the type of each vote. This data model is crucial for allowing users to influence
                the ranking of playlists posted to the platform.

                Comments add a layer of interaction and discussion between users, and facilitate a communal space on the
                platform. The data model for comments will consist of a unique CommentID, along with PlaylistID and
                UserID to associate comments with specific users and playlists. We will also implement a Content field
                to store the contents of a comment as well as a CreatedAt timestamp, so we can display the age of a
                comment.

                The playlist data model will serve as the heart of the application, the primary content around which
                users interact with. Each playlist will have a unique PlaylistID for identification, as well as a UserID
                to associate the user who submitted the playlist. We will have a SpotifyURL field that will be important
                when fetching information from the Spotify API such as the track list. Fields like Title, Description,
                and optionally CoverImage are important for displaying the playlist within the application, providing
                users with a snapshot of what to expect before they decide to explore the playlist further. We also wish
                to include timestamp information such as CreatedAt and UpdatedAt to help track the lifecycle of a
                playlist submission, allowing for the management and update of playlist information over time.

                In conclusion, the thoughtful structuring and management of data are pivotal to the success and
                scalability of our application. By mindfully designing data models for users, votes, comments, and
                playlists, we lay the groundwork for a dynamic and secure platform. This strategic approach to data
                handling promises a scalable, user-centric platform poised for success.
