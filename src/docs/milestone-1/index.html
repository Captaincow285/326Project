                Music is a meaningful way for people to communicate thoughts, emotions, and other aspects of
                the human experience to one another. Sharing what songs, artists, and genres one is listening
                to is a form of socializing that is highly demanded by many. However, today's most popular
                music streaming services (Spotify, Apple Music, etc.) do not provide outlets for users to
                easily share their music tastes on a broad scale. TuneShare aims to address this issue by
                offering a place for music listeners to share Spotify playlists with not just their friends,
                but all users of the site. Similar to traditional social media platforms, our application will
                have features that allow users with an account to post playlists, upvote or downvote the
                playlists of others, suggest additions to playlists, and more.
